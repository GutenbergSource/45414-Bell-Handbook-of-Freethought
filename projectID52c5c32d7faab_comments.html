<HTML><BODY>Another atheist book from over a century ago (that is, from 1893).

<p>Pretty straightforward text. Please leave a space around the colons in bible references, thus: Gen. 1 : 1. For all other colons, the normal rules apply. (This way, I can easily pick out the bible references using a script, and link them to a full text of the bible, so people can click to them and read them in context.)

<p>Have fun!
